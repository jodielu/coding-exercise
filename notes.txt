- bring reused code outside of if statement
- check that subtracting points does not bring below 0
- not using defaultdict
- nested for loops over the same list
- get rid of print statements
- poor naming of boolean
- put boolean directly into conditional statement
- don't use raise in the middle of the loop if we want to continue
- use constants instead of 17
- add default for rewards points to be 0
- rearrange logic so that we only update amount_spent if we have a customer id
- update `items_purchased` variable name so it doesn't match
- add error log?
